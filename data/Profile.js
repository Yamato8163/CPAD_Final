  ABOUT: "Mississippi mud to silicon dreams. Code became my script, the keyboard my stage. Clean lines, poetic comments. Explained algorithms like narrating a documentary. Debugging? My voice, a force for guidance. Unit testing? Monologues, variable names with flair. Never craved the spotlight, just the quiet satisfaction of crafting solutions. Code, a story told, a legacy in its own right. Morgan Freeman, the developer. Behind the lines, making the code sing.",
