    content: "In the last two days, I was working on the user authentication of the app. I'm learning a lot along the way, Supabase is a great BAAS, we could set up things quite fast with it in React. Also, today I integrated SendGrid with Supabase so we can have more control over the emails. üìß I looked at other SMTPs like Resend, MailerSend, and AWS SES but SendGrid looked quite easy to set up and didn't require a domain so for now it's great for testing purposes.If you know any other SMTPs then let me know, maybe in my future projects I will use something different. üí°",
